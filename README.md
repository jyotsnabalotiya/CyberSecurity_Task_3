# CyberSecurity_Task_3

## Task: Perform a Basic Vulnerability Scan on Your PC
### ðŸ›  Tool Used: OpenVAS 


## Objective

To identify potential vulnerabilities on my local machine using a free vulnerability scanner and understand risk levels, CVEs, and basic remediation steps.


## Tools & Setup

- **Scanner Used**: [OpenVAS (Greenbone Vulnerability Manager) / Nessus Essentials]
- **Platform**: Kali Linux / Windows 10 / Other (mention your OS)
- **Target**: My own system (localhost / local IP)


## Steps Followed

1. Installed and configured the scanner.
2. Created a full system scan task.
3. Ran the scan on `127.0.0.1` or my local IP.
4. Waited for the scan to complete (~30 mins).
5. Analyzed vulnerabilities by severity and CVE ID.
6. Researched top critical vulnerabilities.
7. Took relevant screenshots of the scan report.
